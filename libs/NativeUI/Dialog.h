 * \brief Class that represents a modal dialog.
 * A dialog cannot have any parent, it acts only as a container of other widgets.
 * A dialog is a sort of modal view, that can look different depending on
 * the platform:
 * -On Android it is a modal alert dialog.
 * -On iPad it is a PopoverController, and on iPhone it is a modal view.
 *
 * When a Dialog widget is created it is empty, it has no content.
 * Use setMainWidget(widget) to set the main widget of the dialog.
 *
 * A Dialog gets visible only after calling show() method.
 * To show a Dialog call show(), to hide it call: hide().
 *
 * On iPad there are two specific methods:
 * 	- setArrowPosition that sets the position of the popover origin arrow on
 * the screen.
 *  - canBeDismissed that allows or prohibits the user from dismissing a
 *  popover dialog by tapping outside of it.
 *
 * Note that on Android setting widget specific properties has effects only in
 * the dialog content(that is in fact the main widget), and not on the title bar.
 *
 * For dialog events see DialogListener.
