/** \file GLMoblet.h
* \brief OpenGL|ES fullscreen moblet.
*
* The GLMoblet class provides an object-oriented wrapper around the
* C event system in MoSync. It automatically sets up a fullscreen
* OpenGL|ES 1.1 or 2.0 view and calls the function init. Afterwards
* it calls the function continuously until stopDrawing has been
* called. It automatically binds the gl context when the gl view is
* ready and then calls init. No gl calls are allowed until init has
* been invoked.
